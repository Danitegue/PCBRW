Revision History Since Last Major Release
=========================================

3.75a (March 30, 1999)
-----

 - The DELAY variable no longer needs to be set.  Brewer communications
   is now timed precisely.  (Specifically, line 280 of MAIN.BAS/ASC
   changed: "->" is now "-> ".
 - The FR routine reported discrepancies incorrectly for Brewers with
   new Brewer electronics.  This has been fixed.

3.75 (January 18, 1999)
----

 - The Brewer software is now year 2000 compliant.  Several bug fixes
   were required to do this.  This does NOT address the problem of PC
   clocks that do not support date settings beyond the year 2000, which
   cannot be fixed via software.  It should also be noted that this
   software will NOT work past the year 2049; a new software system
   will be available well before that time.

 - The new Brewer electronics are fully supported with this release.
   The software usage is the same as for older Brewers; however, you
   may notice slight differences in some diagnostic messages.  AP
   displays several new values if the new Brewer electronics are
   present.  Resets (such as via RE) take longer in the new electronics,
   but motor resets are quicker (because the hardware resets them, not
   the software).

 - The year was not rolling over correctly in most parts of the world.
   In addition, an incorrect B file was created between the Julian year
   rollover and GMT year rollover.  This has been fixed.

 - Support for a moisture sensor has been added to the software.  Both
   relative humidity and moisture values can be obtained.

 - FM was causing strange problems if it was the last entry in a
   schedule file.  This has been fixed.

 - FM did not work correctly over a Julian or GMT day change.  This has
   been fixed.

 - A new constant, the zenith UVB dome step position, has been added to
   the constants file.  Old constants files do NOT have to be updated;
   the software will properly handle the absence of the new constant.

 - DT and RS turn off the lamp when terminated by the home key.

 - ST did not handle the azimuth and zenith motor positioning correctly.
   This has been fixed.

 - Some miscellaneous scheduling problems have been fixed.

 - RE has been enhanced to provide additional diagnostic information
   during reset.  A reminder is displayed to inform the operator if the
   tracker is supposed to be on; if one is not available, than IC should
   be used to disable it.

 - A new routine, RL, has been added to read log messages from the
   Brewer.  This is only useful for the new electronics boards.

 - The response utilities (RES_II/RES_III/RES_IV) now fit the logarithm
   of Y versus X instead of Y versus X.

 - The version number of the software is now displayed on the screen.

 - The size of the MAIN.BAS file has been reduced by about 250 bytes.


3.74e (April 8, 1996)
-----

 - The Brewer disks have been reorganzied.  The operating software and
   all SCI-TEC utilities have been moved onto the operating software
   disk, and all customer utilities are on the utilities disk.
   SCI-TEC distributes but DOES NOT SUPPORT any utilities on the
   utilities disk.

 - The filename of the UV response file being used is now recorded on
   the UVSUM printout, as well as in the UVOAVG file.

 - An additional diagnostic line has been added to the standard
   printout text for the HG test.

 - The date change bug at the end of year that affected some sites has
   been fixed.  Input checking has been changed to allow entry of
   dates beyond the year 1999.

 - The display box of recent results on the screen has been fixed to
   correctly show the first reading of the day, and clear when the
   julian day changes.  The box is shown while a schedule is waiting
   for the next zenith angle entry to occur.

 - The current zenith angle is now displayed at all times, in the
   upper right-hand side of the screen.

 - The Brewer prompt message no longer prints to the printer.  It
   prints to the screen only.

 - The AUC routine now runs the end-of-day sequence.

 - The 374CVT.EXE utility has been fixed to generate its output files
   correctly.  A couple of unnecessary questions have been removed.

 - SC has been upgraded to print to file if PD is in effect.  Error
   checking has been added to prevent it from crashing.

 - UM has been changed to correctly point the Brewer at all times.

 - The 'device fault in 3287' bug has been fixed.

 - OZSUM and FZSUM have been changed so that the '%' character does
   not show up when poor SO2 readings are written to the relevant
   average files.

 - Aborting the TT routine when using the R command caused the Brewer
   to reset.  This has been fixed.

 - Certain reset conditions caused the Brewer to reset twice instead
   of once.  This has been fixed.

 - The CI routine has been updated to the correct wavelengths for
   each Brewer type.  Also, a bug affecting usage with non-extended
   range MKIV Brewers has been fixed.

 - TESTFW2 has been changed to append each test to its output file.

 - FZSUM now corrects its FZ data for the current day if ETC values
   or temperature constants have been changed.

 - ZC/ZB/ZP have been updated to include the minimum filterwheel #2
   position test.


3.74d (October 30, 1995)
-----

 - Main.bas program operation was speeded up in lines 45, 1410, 3580,
 6910, 6915, 8215, 9460.  Aborts were improved in lines 2093,
 9460-9490, 9510, 9930.  Comment and prompt messages in lines 3060 and
 9585-9590.  Info Box on screen in lines 4275 and 6815.  DI default in
 line 290 changed to 5 cm.  The version number recorded at start of
 B-files was changed to 2 (line 4505), to signify mainly that slit 0
 is not used on FM, FZ and UM measurements now - like version 0 again
 for these measurements.

 - RE.rtn was found to need FW#3 reset code also to solve FW#3 error
 movement in MKIV Brewers after an RE without a FR following it.  In
 ED this sequence of REFR was being done which would set the FW#3
 motor.  However if only a RE was done then the first UV scan
 following would end with FW#3 postioned to step 225 instead of 242.
 Initialization of Filterwheels 1+2 and Iris was improved also.

 - UV.rtn was speeded up by increasing speed of micrometer motor(s)
 which decreases measurement times by 25% and allow the UA measurement
 to be done with 3 second increments.  Errors with certain UVRES files
 with MKIV Brewers were corrected.  The file recording structure into
 the UV file was changed by added line feed after each wavelength
 measurement.  The time of measurement recorded in DUVjddyr.### file
 was fixed to be time at 325nm for each type of measurement.  This
 change was also made in UVSUM.rtn for printout.

- HG, SI, SIM, SR routines had changes made so they print error and 
 final setting messages into B-file as comments.

 - FZ routine bug with SKY Light counts (only 1 cycle) was fixed and
 slit 0 measurements removed.  The SKY light counts are now recorded
 to B-file.

 - DS and ZS routines were changed so that temperature is measured
 just before the start - to remove some errors in temperature on some
 systems.  The possibility of filterwheel #2 moving to position 5 if
 HOME key pressed during intensity check is removed, we believe.  The 
 ZB, ZC and ZP routines were made similar to ZS to avoid confusion.

 - FM measurements improved to stay on moon tracking and not move back
 to sun during other measurements.  Slit 0 measurements removed to
 reduce the total measurement time.

 - UM measurements were changed back to not collecting data from Slit 0.
 This required a small change to SUM routine also.

 - The OZSUM and NOSUM routines were revised to re-format printouts 
 better.  OZSUM now writes daily mean to OZOAVGyr.### file, year added
 in name.
 
 - SKC operation was improved with initialization of ZS to -200 in
 main program lines 310, 3490, 5924.  The sreen display box is now 
 displayed when SKC operation is waiting.  The SA routine was up-dated
 to stop a problem with SKC operation after use of SA.

 - No Brewer operation was changed to only requiring a separate batch
 file to start, rather than having to edit in IC routine and OP_ST.###
 files.  To accomodate this Q12% operation was reserved and set in
 lines 5262, 5370 of MAIN program.  Environment variable NOBREW is
 read and set in line 46.  NOBREW.bat file must contain setting of this
 variable now, (modify BREWER.bat file with addtion of 'SET NOBREW=1' at
 beginning of file and 'SET NOBREW=' at the end).  At the beginning of
 BREWER.bat file the statement 'SET NOBREW=' should be added also.
 IC.rtn had a small change to show Q12% being reserved now.  The
 CI.rtn was modified to change measurement ranges for MKIII and MKIV
 Brewers. The AU routine had a invalid line which was affecting
 operation in NO2 mode with MKIV.
